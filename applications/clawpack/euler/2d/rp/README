Riemann solvers for the Euler equations:

Use one of the following pairs of Riemann solvers 
   (only rpn2 is needed if dimensional splitting is used, method(2) < 0)

rpn2eu4.f    Roe solver with mwaves=4
rpt2eu.f    


rpn2eu3.f    Roe solver with mwaves=3  (shear and entropy waves together)
rpt2eu.f    
             

rpn2eu5.f    Roe solver with meqn=mwaves=5, with 5'th equation for 
rpt2eu5.f        passive tracer advected at fluid velocity


rpn2euq3.f    Roe solver with mwaves=3 on quadrilateral grid
rpt2euq.f
