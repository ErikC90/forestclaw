## ---------------------------
## No solver
## ---------------------------
## This needs work because all exchange functions (copy, average, 
## interpolate) are stored in solvers, and not in a patch.  To 
## fix this, the patch needs to know something about data layout.  
## The clawpatch currently doesn't know about data layout.
